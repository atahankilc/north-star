# Decisions Log

Format: `D-xxx · date · status (Accepted | Proposed | Superseded by D-yyy)`

---

### D-001 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Frontend hosted on GitHub Pages as a static SPA.**
Why: free, reliable. Implications: no server, so use HashRouter and deploy with GitHub Actions.

### D-002 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**No self-hosted or free-tier app server. Use a managed DB service the browser talks to directly.**
Why: free backend hosts cold-start or shut down, giving bad UX and latency.
Implications: security is enforced by the DB service's permission rules.

### D-003 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**React + three.js (via @react-three/fiber) for the UI.**
Why: the user wants a visual, animated 3D experience.

### D-004 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Design language: 3D ASCII, mostly black and white with vivid accent colours.**
Why: user preference, based on the references in `docs/design/references/`. See [DESIGN.md](../docs/DESIGN.md).

### D-005 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Real-time collaboration with live cursors and presence is in scope.**

### D-006 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**AI uses BYOK OpenAI keys, entered on a Settings page, with a cheap model by default.**
The key is stored only in the user's browser and never in the DB. Calls go directly to OpenAI.
Why: no backend to hold secrets, and collaborators must not see each other's keys.

### D-007 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Features are their own view and entity, linked to ideas** (not just an idea with a tag).

### D-008 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Web only. Authentication required. Export/import and attachments (images, PDFs, drawings) are in scope.**

### D-009 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Hybrid rendering: 3D scene in WebGL, readable and editable text in the DOM. The ASCII effect never covers editable text.**
Why: accessibility, text editing quality, readability.

### D-010 · 2026-10-17 · Superseded by D-014
**Backend: InstantDB.** It covers auth, DB, permissions, storage and presence/cursors, and free projects are not paused.
Alternatives: Firebase (mature, but presence is hand-built and storage may need a billing plan), Supabase (free projects pause after about a week of inactivity).
Mitigation: all access goes through the `src/data/` adapter.

### D-011 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Sign-in: Google OAuth only.** (Resolves Q-002.)
Implementation: Firebase Auth Google provider, popup flow (updated after D-014).

### D-012 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Workspaces are shared with an invite code.** The owner generates a code, and others sign in with Google and enter it to join.
The code is stored on the workspace and can be regenerated to revoke it. (Partly resolves Q-007; roles are still open.)

### D-013 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Fonts: Geist (display/UI) + Geist Mono (data/ASCII).** (Resolves Q-005.) Self-hosted through `@fontsource-variable/geist` and `geist-mono`, with no external font CDN.

### D-014 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Backend: Firebase.** Firestore for data, Realtime Database for presence and cursors, Firebase Auth for Google sign-in. Spark (free) plan.
Why: InstantDB's hosted service is shutting down (team joined OpenAI in Aug 2026, sign-ups closed, apps stop 2027-08-31).
Longevity became the top criterion. Firebase never pauses, has no cold starts, and is Google-backed.
Rejected: Convex (cursor updates burn function-call quota, startup risk), Supabase (free projects pause).

### D-015 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Attachments are deferred. Stay on Spark with no card for now.** Firebase Storage needs the Blaze plan
(card required, 5 GB free). Revisit in Phase 5. Options then: Blaze plus a $1 budget alert, or an alternative store.

### D-016 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Presence lives in RTDB at `presence/{wid}/{uid}`. It is readable by any signed-in user, and each user can write only their own node.**
Why: RTDB rules can't read Firestore membership, and mirroring it securely needs Cloud Functions (Blaze).
Exposure is limited to name, colour and cursor coordinates, behind a random workspace ID. Revisit if Blaze is enabled.

### D-017 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Product name: North Star** (formerly "Mind-Map"). Resolves Q-010.
The Firebase project is `north-star-db`. The GitHub Pages base path comes from the repo name in CI, so a repo rename needs no code change.
The local folder is still `mind-map`.

### D-018 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Idea canvas is 2.5D:** a flat board in a real three.js scene, with a perspective camera that pans and zooms (no rotation),
cards as lit 3D slabs that lift on hover and drag, and edges as curved dashed lines. Resolves Q-008.
Full 3D stays available for transitions and competitor maps later.

### D-019 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted (refines D-009)
**Card display text is WebGL SDF text (troika via drei `<Text>`); all editing happens in the DOM detail panel.**
Why: crisp at any zoom, no DOM churn per card, and cards stay real 3D objects. The ASCII pass still never covers the board.
troika can't read woff2, so the scene uses static `.woff` Geist from `@fontsource/geist(-mono)`.

### D-020 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Local development and tests run on Firebase emulators** (`npm run dev:emu`, `npm run test:rules`) with a `demo-` project,
so nothing can reach production. Test users (Alice, Bob, Carol) sign in with fake Google tokens. The RTDB emulator uses port **9010**
(9000 clashes with OrbStack). Its namespace must be `<project>-default-rtdb` for the rules to apply.

### D-021 · 2026-10-17 · Accepted
**Roles for the MVP: owner + editor.** Resolves Q-007. Owner: members, invite code, delete. Editor: everything else.
Enforced in `firestore.rules`, covered by `tests/rules.test.mjs`.
