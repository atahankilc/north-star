# Project State

_Last updated: 2026-10-17_

## Phase
**Phase 1: Single-user core**, mostly done. Remaining: groups (Q-012), undo/keyboard delete (Q-013).

## Done
- **Phase 0**: specs, memory bank, scaffold, ASCII design language, GitHub Pages workflow (commit `e114f34`)
- Backend: Firebase project `north-star-db` (Google auth, Firestore, RTDB europe-west1); `.env.local` filled; rules deployed
- **Rules verified**: `tests/rules.test.mjs`, 33 checks on the emulators (membership, invite-code join, roles, presence)
- **Emulator dev mode** (`npm run dev:emu`) with test users Alice/Bob/Carol (D-020)
- **Workspaces page**: live list, create (with invite code), join by code (case and dash insensitive), error states
- **Idea canvas** (`src/views/canvas/`):
  - R3F board: pan (drag empty board), zoom to cursor, faint `+` grid, dimmed ASCII backdrop
  - Cards: lit slabs, accent strip, SDF title/notes/tags, hover lift, stable layering
  - Create: double-click the board or `[ + IDEA ]` (nearest free spot)
  - Drag to move: live local position, writes streamed every 120 ms (collaborators see moves), smooth damping for remote moves
  - Shift+drag card → card to link; curved dashed animated edges; duplicates prevented
  - Detail panel: title, notes, tags, colour, links (change kind, remove, jump), two-step delete (also deletes its edges)
  - Invite chip copies the code; non-members see "not found or not a member"
- Verified end to end in Chrome on the emulators (create, edit, drag, link, join as Bob, Carol refused)

## Next steps
1. Groups / clusters (Q-012)
2. Undo + Delete key (Q-013)
3. Phase 2: competitors, competitor maps, features view, comparison matrix
4. Phase 3 polish: presence + live cursors (RTDB rules are ready)
5. Deploy: add `atahankilic.github.io` to Firebase Authorized domains, add the GitHub Pages variables, then push

## Blockers
- None

## Notes for future sessions
- In a hidden or background browser tab rAF is paused. In dev, `window.__advance(t, true)` steps frames and `window.__canvas` exposes the canvas store.
- Chrome screenshots are scaled: viewport 2560 px vs 1568 px frame, so script clientX/Y needs ×(innerWidth/1568).
- OrbitControls listens on the Board's wrapper div (not the canvas), so card handlers run first and can disable panning.
- The bundle is about 1.6 MB (three + drei + firebase). Code-split views later.
